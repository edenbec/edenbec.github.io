  A current student in Geospatial Technology (graduating with a Master's degree
  in Summer of 2022).  I have a fascination with maps and creating "A picture worth a thousand words".
  <br><br>
  Currently working as an Accounting Manager with 10+ years of experience.  I
  enjoy working with numbers as much as I enjoy creating maps. I would love to find
  a position that enables me to do both.
